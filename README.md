Internal Data Reporting System for PPM Research and Community Service
SPDI is a platform managed by the Campus Institution that collects data and monitors the activities of the Tri Dharma of Higher Education in the fields of Research and Community Service.
The data collected is reported during each semester of the academic year in the related campus environment. The data obtained is based on internal report sources from each academic department, supported by Application Programming Interface (API) technology from several relevant sources.
The data we collect is public data. Visitors are welcome to use the data we have according to their respective interests.
For management purposes, SPDI can also be managed independently through the Editor program, specifically designed for its managers.
